# Room Allotment and Booking System

## Overview
This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application developed in C++ that simulates a room allotment and booking system. It demonstrates the use of advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Features
The system includes the following features:
- **Book a Room**: Allocate a room for meetings or events.
- **Reserve a Seat**: Reserve a seat in a room.
- **Display Room Information**: Display the details of a room including the host, start time, end time, and seating arrangement.
- **List All Rooms**: List all the rooms that have been booked.

## Usage
To use the system, compile the C++ source files and run the generated executable. Follow the on-screen prompts to book a room, reserve a seat, display room information, or list all rooms.

## Code Structure
The `Room` class represents a room with seating and reservation information. It includes methods to initialize chairs, check seat availability, reserve a seat, and display room information.

The `getValidInt` function is used to get a valid integer input from the user.

The `main` function contains the main loop of the application, where the user is presented with a menu of options to choose from.

## Contribution
Contributions to this project are welcome. Please ensure that you follow the coding standards and write tests for new features.
